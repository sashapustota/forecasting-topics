8,1,germany_2023,"Quantum sensors also offer new applications that are complementary to classic technologies. By directly relating the measurement methods to natural constants, which are defined without uncertainty by the recent redefinition of the SI system of units (2019), they offer novel possibilities for reliable, ubiquitous and highly precise sensor technology. Overall, quantum-based measurement technology is a heterogeneous field with a wide variety of technologies and numerous promising, some of which are already market-ready, application options."
8,2,germany_2023,"This ensures the guarantee of quality, traceable and secured performance parameters and the comparability of QT components. As a cross-sectional task, independent metrological characterization and qualification of components must also be considered and developed from the outset for a stable, trustworthy and reliable value chain in the emerging quantum technology industry."
8,3,germany_2023,"In international comparison, the USA is currently the world leader, particularly in quantum computing. Large corporations such as Google and IBM currently represent the state of the art in the field of superconducting quantum computing. The USA also has the highest number of start-ups in quantum technologies (92), the highest venture capital raised ($2.2 billion from 2001 to 2021) and the most academic research groups (64). The national funding is distributed across a wide range of national agencies and organizations (including NIST, NASA, DARPA) with different thematic and strategic focuses. Total government funding in 2022 was approximately $0.9 billion."
8,4,germany_2023,"Quantum-based measurement technology is probably the field with the highest technological maturity in the field of quantum technologies. For example, nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond are already used in special microscopes. The first quantum gravimeters are also available on the market and enable the measurement of the Earth's gravity field for applications in geology or geodesy."
8,5,germany_2023,"The cross-sectional field of basic technologies (“Enabling Technologies”) is particularly indispensable for the further development of quantum technologies. It is already developing economic potential: the first markets for special lasers, control electronics and cooling technology for quantum systems have already emerged. In particular, highly specialized start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are able to generate their first sales. The future challenge will be to develop innovative overall systems from this sum of individual components and to open up further possible uses."
8,6,germany_2023,"Quantum sensing and quantum metrology state of technology in international comparison basic technologies. However, quantum metrology is not only limited to quantum sensing. It is generally concerned with making high-resolution and high-sensitivity measurements of physical parameters using quantum effects such as quantum entanglement. Quantum metrology thus promises the development of measurement techniques that enable greater precision than the same measurement using classical methods. For example, electrical quantum metrology can develop conventional measurement technology into a comprehensive quantum measurement technology. Among other things, programmable “quantum voltmeters” are already available on the market."
8,7,germany_2023,"Assumptions. A wide variety of quantum communication methods have now been demonstrated in applications, both in optical fibers and between satellites and in terrestrial free-beam connections. However, range and data rate still represent a challenge for broad application relevance. For this reason, the development of quantum repeaters, which are required as nodes to extend transmission routes, is essential as a key component for quantum communication over long distances."
9,1,germany_2023,"Use of quantum technologies is growing, especially in the field of quantum computing. However, the North American company's research activity in this area is lagging behind. Significant public funding for quantum technologies has currently been announced in the European Union ($7.2 billion in the EU versus $1.9 billion in the USA). In Germany alone, 2 billion euros are available for research and development in quantum technologies as part of the federal government's future package. "
9,2,germany_2023,"However, there is significantly less venture capital available, especially compared to the USA (0.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion). In terms of scientific publications, the European Union is a leader, both in academic quality and breadth. The number of start-ups has also more than tripled since 2015, but is far below the US figures."
9,3,germany_2023,"It is important for Germany to benefit economically and socially from the development of quantum technologies and to establish sovereign access to this future technology. The initial situation is assessed as follows: Less in international comparison with a total of $15 billion, China has announced by far the highest government funding in an international comparison. "
9,4,germany_2023,"Specific structures and strategies are less transparent, but important work has already been published on a scientific and technological level. With the help of the Micius research satellite, an intercontinental key exchange using quantum cryptographic methods was demonstrated in 2018. There are also increasing developments in quantum computing that indicate a high technological level."
9,5,germany_2023,"Quantum information theory is lacking in science and business within the framework of the dual education system and strong universities. There is a high public investment in the development of quantum technologies, and a good culture of collaboration between distinctive industrial sectors with many potential users of the technology. However, there are hurdles for start-ups and their support, and ongoing research work on almost all relevant technology platforms is needed."
5,1,eu_2005,"The reader can understand the advantages of quantum computing with respect to classical computing and the basic concepts of quantum computer science. This is followed by an article on quantum simulations, which explains how this approach can obtain results circumventing some of the difficulties of universal quantum computation. The article on decoherence presents a fundamental physical issue in QIPC and is one of its critical challenges. Next is a group of nine articles: each presenting a possible specific realization of a quantum information processor (QIP) based on a different physical system. To our knowledge, there exist two realisations of a QIP that are not presented here: one is based on nuclear magnetic resonance and the other one – on quantum dots. To date, no one specific realisation has proved to be the winning one. At present, some of them demonstrate more advantages than others or are at a more advanced stage of development. Only further research can show how a future QIP will look like. The final two articles present concrete spin-off applications of the basic principles of QIPC."

It is clear that QIPC research has gained an important European dimension which is crucial for its further development. It is, however, necessary to expand and strengthen activities at the European level. We are working towards common goals and a common European strategy. It is crucial to support and maintain research in the main areas of QIPC: quantum communication, computation and information theory."
7,5,eu_2005,"At this stage it is also important to keep a diversity of experimental realizations and approaches, and yet actively to look for synergies and integration between them in order to reach concrete objectives. Some areas of QIPC seem closer to achieving a number of landmark results and have the potential to make possible concrete applications within a medium-term future. We need to ensure timely and appropriate concentration of efforts and coordination of activities in these areas. Breakthroughs of the type needed to make QIPC a reality cannot be expected to follow a precise timetable."

The contract is extended till the end of 2007 and cooperation with the CA QUROPE is established."
4,2,eu_2006,"QUROPE (1 M€): It aims at structuring the European QIPC research community around the FET QIPC proactive initiative and covers a large spectrum of activities like: Develop a common European vision, strategy and goals for QIPC research by developing and updating the QIPC roadmap, Increase the public visibility and aim at broad dissemination activities, Develop and support an Electronic Information Infrastructure and Information Exchange (with a feedback channel), Organize scientific meetings, Create links with industry, Develop international collaboration outside of Europe. It is important to note that the consortium consists of 34 research groups, among the best from all over Europe. These play the role of regional focal points for other 43 research groups who are defined as affiliated members. In this way a considerable part of the scientific community can participate in the actions undertaken by the project. The decision making process is in the power of the Governing Board which consists of 19 well known scientists. Therefore the project is central to the entire QIPC scientific community and plays the role of its collective representative. It has reached a higher level of maturity and integration than all other similar actions in the past."
4,4,eu_2006,"In order to complete the picture of the projects in the area of QIPC funded by the European Commission research program in general, it is important to include the existing two Marie Curie research training networks funded by the Marie Curie program of DG RTD. They are CONQUEST: Controlled Quantum Coherence and Entanglement is Sets of Trapped Particles and ATOMCHIPS."
6,1,eu_2006,"• Maintain a global overview at European level  All these elements need to be in dynamic equilibrium between each other and it is very important to respond on time and proactively to:  • the changing needs of the community  • the fast research developments • changes at EU and Commission level • changes in the international scene  Keeping all these objectives in mind, it is very beneficial to maintain  continuity and to build on what has been already achieved. Part of it is to keep the traditions already established over the years. "
6,2,eu_2006,"There are two major annual events organized within the framework of the QIPC proactive initiative since 2000: The first one is a ‘cluster review’ with a conference. Its goals are to review and evaluate the work of each project and how its objectives fit within the common objectives of the initiative, to revise priorities if necessary and to evaluate the progress of the initiative as a whole. In 2005 and 2006, a detailed cluster review report was written after every review. "
6,3,eu_2006,"The second event is the annual European QIPC workshop where projects and individual research groups present their work. Both events are the focal point for the scientific community and serve as a platform for information exchange and an open forum for scientific discussions. Since 2004, at each of these events it was also organized a ‘special session’ to discuss the strategy and planning of the QIPC proactive initiative and to launch new actions. A list of all the events with some comments is available at the end of this article.     "
6,4,eu_2006,"Preparation for FP7 and a Common European strategy for research in QIPC: While the field has now reached a certain degree of maturity and there is critical mass in Europe in the main sub-domains, it is necessary to substantially expand and strengthen activities at European level. In view of the forthcoming FP7, FET and the European QIPC research community have been actively working during 2005 and 2006 towards the elaboration of a common European research strategy. "
6,5,eu_2006,"These efforts have culminated in the scientific and technological roadmap “Quantum Information Processing and Communication: Strategic report on current status, visions and goals for research in Europe”. This was really a community effort, as it can be seen from the substantial list of 40 contributors, who are among the most prominent scientists in Europe. The editing author is Prof. Peter Zoller from the University of Innsbruck. The document is an impressive joint effort of the European scientific community and a good example how European research can be adequately structured with the help from the respective EU program. After an initial consultation within the research community, in April 2005 the first version of the strategic report was published on the FET and on the ERA Pilot – QIST project web sites. The goal was to initiate a broader discussion and receive feedback in order to make appropriate corrections. "
6,6,eu_2006,"The report presents in a comprehensive way the state-of-the-art, the medium and long term goals, the visions and challenges in a general roadmap-type document. It includes a Foreword by Director Mr. Ulf Dahlsten, an executive summary, an overview of the general scientific and technological context of the field, an overview of the activities of the FET QIPC proactive initiative, a description of national research programs and the worldwide research position of Europe in QIPC. The main bulk of the document is devoted to a scientific assessment of current results and an outlook for future efforts. It covers the three main research sub-domains: quantum communication, quantum computation and quantum information science, as well as the interactions and interdependences between them. The document stipulates the need for further support in these three research directions, as well as to keep a diversity of experimental realizations and to look for synergies between them."
7,1,eu_2006,"Integration across different disciplines and between different experimental approaches is considered crucial for the further advancement of QIPC in Europe. Prospects for applications and commercial exploitation are equally discussed. The initial version of the roadmap was extensively discussed within the scientific community and subsequently at a series of special sessions organized by FET at the traditional events. One new version was published as an official publication of the European Communities in October 2005 and another one in The European Physical Journal D - Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. The roadmap is a living document, which is updated every six months. This is done in the context of the project ERA Pilot QIST by the team of WP1. After the end of the project this activity will be continued by the same team in the context of QUROPE WP2. Each update is subject to a wide consultation."
7,2,eu_2006,"The objective is that the QIPC roadmap serves as a guideline both to scientists and to decision makers in order to shape the future of QIPC in Europe. It will determine the strategic research agenda for the next decade. In the period January – March 2006 there was a general FP7 consultation process called BTH (Beyond-the-Horizon) in 7 FET domains. In parallel and independently of this action, the QIPC proactive initiative carried out a consultation forum on the web site of the project ERA Pilot QIST. The QIPC roadmap was subject to discussion and there were 84 comments submitted."
7,3,eu_2006,"A summary of the research goals of the QIPC roadmap were elaborated in the period March - May 2006, after the roadmap was published and updated several times. These pages reflect in a nutshell the entire scientific part of the roadmap and are the result of a long and careful reflection by the entire team of contributing authors and at a second stage by the entire scientific community. It is written in ""Scientific American style"" and therefore is understandable by a wider audience. For each of the main sub-domains (quantum communication, computation and information) the research goals and priorities divided in short-term (up to 5 years) and long-term (up to 10 years) were clearly and comprehensively defined. The summary includes a fourth section on integration and synergies between the three main sub-domains. The idea was to present in a comprehensive and accessible way the main scientific challenges which would serve as a starting point in FP7."
7,4,eu_2006,Another major effort for preparation of FP7 is a second official publication of the European Communities “QIPC in Europe”. This is a booklet of about 250 pages which contains 30 articles written by 58 of the most prominent scientists in Europe. Each article gives a comprehensive overview of one specific area of QIPC and refers to work accomplished within the framework of EC and nationally funded projects. The publication as a whole gives a balanced overview of QIPC research activities and achievements in Europe. The booklet includes a Foreword by Commissioner Ms Viviane Reding. The entire text is available on the FET web site and is printed as EC publication. The QIPC roadmap and the collection of articles complement each other and are important milestones along the way towards elaborating a common European strategy in QIPC.
7,5,eu_2006,"The QIPC classification scheme is a logical continuation of the roadmap. It was elaborated by Tommaso Calarco and Daniele Binosi within the framework of ERA Pilot QIST WP1. Profiting from their experience gained while writing the roadmap, they have scanned through thousands of QIPC publications in recent years in order to give a systematic overview of the research subjects treated therein. A concise version of the QICS classification scheme will be integrated in the PACS codes (universal classification scheme for physics)."
8,2,eu_2006,"At the plenary session of the IST Conference in Helsinki entitled "" Opportunities for ICT Research & Development Beyond 2007"" one of the four invited speakers was Prof. Anton Zeilinger from the University of Vienna. He gave a talk on "" Quantum Information Processing and Quantum Communication: A Crucial Opportunity for European Collaborative Research "". FP7 is starting in January 2007. The intention is to continue the QIPC proactive initiative and the support for QIPC research at European level. A call for proposals is planned for January 2009. It is important that the research community in collaboration with FET gets ready for this call by developing the research goals and priorities according to the roadmap, research collaborations and new challenging projects."
8,3,eu_2006,"Forging Collaborations and Alliances: In order to keep the momentum of the European progress in QIPC and the competitiveness of our scientists, it is in Europe's interest to develop a common strategy for international collaboration at pan-European level in a concerted and structured way. Some European countries have strong national programs in QIPC, but the efforts are fragmented and none of them by itself can be a counterpart to the QIPC programs in the developed countries, as research and investment in QIPC have grown tremendously in recent years."
8,4,eu_2006,On the other hand it is very important to establish and maintain research collaborations with good teams outside Europe. This stimulates scientific excellence and cross fertilization between different research cultures and traditions. Therefore the QIPC initiative needs to create the best possible conditions for European scientists to excel in the filed in this global environment.
8,5,eu_2006,"In May 2005 the QUPON Conference (Quantum Physics of Nature) was organized at the University of Vienna. It was a major international event with more than 350 of the best scientists in the world taking part. The Gordon research Conference on Quantum Information Science makes part of the series of high level research events organized by the institution with the same name in the US. In 2006 it took place 7-12 May in Il Ciocco (Italy) and was organized by Peter Zoller (University of Innsbruck) and Ignacio Cirac (Max Planck Institute in Garsching, Germany). There were representatives from US funding agencies and also the coordinator of the FET QIPC PI. In 2007 this conference is organized in the same place in April. It is an important recognition for European research that the GRC on Quantum Information is organized in Europe. The US – Japan Workshop on Quantum Information Science took place on 16 – 20 October in Hawaii. Europe was represented by six scientists (Anton Zeilinger, Hans Briegel, John Rarity, Philippe Grangier, Rainer Blatt, Serge Haroche) and the coordinator of the FET QIPC proactive initiative. The opening session was dedicated to invited talks given by Quantum Information Science program managers from funding agencies in the US, Japan and Europe."
14,16,eu_2008,"QIPC is also funded via the FET -Open continuous submission scheme, which supports l ong-term, risky and visionary research. In this case the research area is not specified in advance and QIPC projects are competing with all "
16,1,eu_2008,"Apart from the EU program, QIPC is also coordinated and funded by several organisations at the national or regional level. All groups involved in QIPC receive support from their home institutions (e.g. universities) in form of building costs, salaries, etc. This basic support is difficult to quantify precisely , for most of the time it is impossible to know the exact costs , and some estimation (e.g. based on the size of the group under scrutiny) would be needed. "
16,2,eu_2008,"In terms of external funding, one can distinguish several levels. The main funding source for QIST programs usually comes from a few national organisations in each country, mainly ministries, government agencies, or Academies of Science. Sometimes local funding comes from regions or cities that wish to attract centers of excellence in QIST. Other sources of funding are emerging, in particular the ones based on start-ups and agencies such as the European Space Agency. Some groups also have grants from American funding agencies, such as DARPA, ARO, and NIST."
16,3,eu_2008,"As a basic research field, QIST is still traditionally funded by the different national governmental organisation depending on the country (ministry, governmental agency etc.). These agencies fund every research topics and QIST is typically a small percentage of the overall budget (in the percent range). However many of them have recently developed focus program or umbrella topics for QIST."
16,4,eu_2008,"The identified main national founders for each country include the Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT), Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), Belgian Federal Science Policy Office, Ministry of Education and Science in Bulgaria, Czech Ministry of Education, Estonian Science Foundation (EstSF), Academy of Finland, and France's Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR). "
16,5,eu_2008,"These founding bodies are representative of a comprehensive list that spans other countries and regions, as well as multiple tiers of governance from the city to national level. Certain regions or cities, for instance Vienna in Austria, have also invested in QIST to attract centres of excellence. In France, the Région Ile de France supports QIST through two main channels: Institut Francilien de Recherche sur les Atomes Froids (IFRAF), and Centre de compétence NanoSciences Ile de france (C'NANO)."
17,1,eu_2008,"17 QIPC Regional initiatives Objectives of the FET QIPC Proactive Initiative are highlighted by countries. In Germany, several initiatives like Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), Bayerisches Staatsministerium, Landesstiftung BW, Max-Planck -Society and VDI Technologiezentrum are in function. Greece, represented by its Ministry of Development, General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT), and Hungary, with its Ministry of Education, Hungarian Scientific Research Fund, and Hungarian Academy of Science, National Office for Research and Technology (NKTH) are active contributors too. Ireland's initiatives are led by the Advisory Science Council (ASC) and Science Foundation of Ireland (SFI)."
17,2,eu_2008,"Italy has its Italian National Research Council (CNR), Ministry for Education and Research (MIUR), Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica (INDAM), Istituto Nazionale d i Ricerca Metrologica (iNRiM), Regione Piemonte, San Paolo Fundation, Nanotechnology lab leading the efforts. QIPC is also one of the two scientific lines that CNISM (Consorzio Interuniversitario per le Scienze Fisiche della Materia) decided to support. Luxembourg is represented by the Fonds National d e la Recherche."
17,3,eu_2008,"Netherlands' efforts are being lead by Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM), Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, and The Technology Foundation (STW). Poland's initiatives are by Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Ministry of Science and Information Technology, and Polish Academy of Sciences. Portugal's initiatives come from Science and Technology Foundation (FCT) and Innovation Agency (AdI). Russia's efforts are driven by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research."
17,4,eu_2008,"Slovakia's initiatives are led by Research and Development Support Agency (APVV). Quantum Information program of the Slovakian Academy of Science takes a noteworthy mention. Spain's efforts are backed by Ministry of Education and Science (MEC), Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT), University of Barcelona, Generalitat de Catalunya, and Madrid General Government. "
17,5,eu_2008,"Sweden is at the forefront with Knowledge Foundation, Swedish Foundation for Strategic research (SSF) via the QIP consortium (Chalmers, Göteborg, and KTH, Stockholm), Swedish Research Council (VR) – Natural and Engineering Sciences, Swedish foundation for International Cooperation, and The Swedish Royal Academy of Science. Switzerland's initiatives are led by the Swiss National science Foundation (SNF). "
17,6,eu_2008,"Turkey's initiatives are steered by Tubitak -Uekae. The United Kingdom's efforts are headlined by the Royal Society, Research Council, DTI Department of Trade and Industry, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research council (EPSRC), and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL)."
17,7,eu_2008,"As a highly promising field, QIST is often supported at the local level (city or region). Several examples in Europe have led to the creation of centers for Quantum Information, sometimes in a more general context. This funding can be quite stable in time, and usually consists in particular of a large startup sum, but also a more long-term support. "
17,8,eu_2008,"One can cite for instance, the region of Catalonia in Spain strongly supported the creation of the Institute for Photonic Science (ICFO) in 2002 in Barcelona, which has a strong emphasis on QIST. This institute is meant to be permanent and, when at full size, will employ up to 300 people. The Region of Tyrol and the city of Innsbruck in Austria also supported the creation of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI); this centre was mentioned as “an example of outstanding quality” for activity in atomic molecular and optical physics research in a recent report of the US National Research Council."
18,1,eu_2008,"18 QIPC‟s own identity as a research field. Europe at the leading edge of QIPC research QIPC in industries and spin-off on Cold Atoms (IFRAF), which comprises more than 30 groups from 6 different laboratories in Greater Paris. The United Kingdom is funding an Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) in QIPC between leading research universities and industrial laboratories. The initiative started in April 2004 with a funding level of 15M € in four years. These initiatives can either, as for ICFO, create a new centre of excellence, or as in the case of IFRAF, construct a new centre of excellence from an existing pool of competence. In most cases the local funding is motivated by the development of a high-impact scientific field and high-level research, and it  has a beneficial impact on local industry and economy."
18,2,eu_2008,"3. 2.3 OTHER FUNDING. As possible applications of QIST become likely to appear in the near future, start-ups have begun to emerge. The main interest so far is in quantum cryptography, in particular Quantum Key Distribution. The oldest European company is IdQuantique, spin-off from the university of Geneva in 2001. Several new appeared recently: SmartQuantum, created in 2004 in Lagnon, France, Qutools in Munich, Germany. Other competing start-ups for early adopters on the market are MagiQ, Optemax, and Qinetiq from the USA. These companies are mostly spin-off of QIST research groups, funded through the usual start-up scheme: university incubators at the early stage of their existence, then business angels or hedge funds to sustain them beyond their first years of existence. They mainly develop commercial fibered QKD systems, but most of them admit that there is no real market for such system yet. There is however already a small but active market for Quantum-based Random Number Generators (IdQuantique)."
18,3,eu_2008,"Quantum computing has also aroused interest for possible commercial applications. However the investment required and the timescale for developing a commercial quantum computer are much larger than for a QKD system. There is no start-up interested in developing a quantum computer in Europe so far, the only example known being  in Canada, where one company (D-WAVE) has been created in 1999. Several very large companies have also interest in QIST, with a focus on applied system research and components. In Europe, the main companies involved are Toshiba (UK), Thalès (France), France Telecom (France), Philips (Netherlands), Pirelli (Italy),  Hitachi (UK) Hewlett-Packard (UK). Worldwide, companies such as IBM and NEC are also involved in QIST. The companies either have their own lab (Toshiba, HP, IBM), and/or can alternatively fund research groups (Philips). It has proven practically impossible to obtain reliable information about the amount of investment in QIST by these companies. "
18,4,eu_2008,"Another interesting source of funding is  the European Space Agency (ESA). Several 50k€ feasibility studies on Quantum Communication in space were successfully completed since 2002 and one experimental terrestrial 200k € study over 144 km horizontal free-space link is ongoing. Within ESA‟s science program, the proposal Space-QUEST (to place a QKD terminal onboard the International Space Station) was rated as „outstanding‟. Several European industries submitted proposals to develop a prototype engineering model of a faint laser and entangled photon source with a total budget of 600k €. In the second half of 2008 a study on the feasibility of a QKD system on various future satellite missions is expected with 300k€. So far more than 1Mio€ have been spent on the different studies under evaluation at the time this report was made. But the overall budget for the Space-QUEST project, if it is accepted, would be approximately  80M € until 2014, with approximately 20% devoted to basic research. If successful, this would make ESA a major funding source for QIST in Europe."
18,5,eu_2008,"3. 3 QIPC RESEARCH IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT. Quantum information processing has become a scientific discipline with its own identity during the last ten years. The advent of quantum cryptography in the 80s and then the recognition of quantum computing in the 90s, for example using Shor‟s algorithm, provided the motivation and have been the starting point of serious experimental and theoretical efforts to realize QIPC at large. Through the activities of the 2000-2004 EC FP5 FET-PI QIPC programme, Europe has, in the main, been at the leading edge of QIS worldwide. The early spearheading of this high-risk R&D effort by the EC has aided in the creation of a number of national investments in QIS with the research area now reaching a more mature stage of medium/high risk. Until now, European publication output and quality has been on a par (and even superior) with the US , while other nations have begun systematic ramp-up in QIS investments. In the last years, significant growths in the research efforts within the field of QIS have been made worldwide. Especially the US has fostered their research activities, supported by a number of public funding agencies, namely the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Today, the US investment in QIPC of estimated 149 Million USD represents nearly 50 % of the worldwide research expenses in this field. Other important nations are Canada (31.6 M USSD ), Japan (20.0 M USD ), Australia (19.1 M USD ), Brazil (15.2 M USD ) and China (14.2 MUSD )."
18,6,eu_2008,"To retain our leading position in research and to capitalize on the Commission‟s already significant investments in QIS ( 50M€ in FP5  and FP6 ), it is vital to ensure that the EC investment in QIS remains competitive with the US and other national/continental QIS investors. Our current intelligence indicates that a Commission investment of 8M€/yr will compete very well with the US investment."
19,1,eu_2008,"1. Funding policies and European QIPC competitiveness poorly with the US , who now federally invests 149 MUSD/yr. Indeed, Australia, with a population of 20 million (EU population is ~450 million), will be federally investing, $8MAUS/yr (5M€/yr), in a coherent QIS effort through its National Centers of Excellence. "
19,2,eu_2008,"2. Among the strongest threats to Europe‟s lead role in Q/NIST/IS is the US FoQuS programme. The FoQuS programme (by the US Defense Advanced Research and Projects Agency), was initially tabled in early 2004 with a specific targeting of quantum computer QIS in a single project funded to ~90MUSD over four years, with worldwide researcher participation. "
19,3,eu_2008,3. This programme has not yet been fully launched but remains under consideration by the US for 2005. With the very significant international targeting of QIS ramping up around the world it is imperative that Europe remains competitive.
19,4,eu_2008,"4. QIS R&D support on the scale of ~ 8M€/year puts Europe at the lower end of worldwide QIS funding support. With such a potential decrease in international competitiveness, there is considerable risk that European research in QIS and the resulting technology developments (commercial and defense), will not be sustainable, leaving Europe reliant on importing such developed QIS technology from abroad."
19,5,eu_2008,"5. Estimated funding o f QIPC outside Europe in Million USD. Salaries represent 64% of the direct costs (costs without any overhead), whereas experimental equipment represents 36% of the direct costs. Overhead costs that are customary in the place have been added."
11,2,eu_2010,"Within a decade, it will be possible to place sources of entangled photons on satellites, which will allow global quantum communication, teleportation and perfectly secure cryptography. Quantum cryptography relies on quantum communication technology but its progress and future impact on secure communication will depend on new protocols such as, for example, quantum-cryptographic authentication and quantum digital signatures."
11,3,eu_2010,"The next thing on the horizon is a quantum simulator. This is a quantum system in which the interactions between the particles could be engineered to simulate another complex system in an efficient way – a task that is inherently intractable on classical, but not quantum, technology. Building quantum simulators would allow, for example, the development of new materials, accurate description of chemical compounds and reactions, or a deeper understanding of high temperature superconductivity. The goal is to push the existing quantum technologies, such as optical lattices, to their limits and build quantum simulators within a decade or so."
11,4,eu_2010,"Last but not least, the search for scalable quantum information technologies goes on. This astonishing field appears to involve practically the whole of physics, and stretches the theoretical and experimental resources of every branch of physics, from quantum optics and atomic physics to solid state devices. It is likely that there will not be a single winner in this search: a number of different technologies will complement each other. Some of them will be more suitable for quantum memories, some of them for quantum processing, some for quantum communication and so on. Therefore, in addition to developing individual technologies, we also need interfaces between these technologies, so that we can transfer a qubit, for example, from a polarized photon to an electron in a quantum dot. The hybrid technologies and architectures for quantum computation, including interfaces between them, are the long-term goals for years to come."
11,5,eu_2010,"Quantum information technology is a fundamentally new way of harnessing Nature and it has potential for truly revolutionary innovation. There is almost daily progress in developing promising technologies for realising quantum information processing with various advantages over its classical counterparts. After all, the best way to predict the future is to create it. From the perspective of the future, it may well be that the real computer age has not yet even begun."
11,6,eu_2010,"3. Different aspects of QIPC research in Europe Quantum Information Processing and Communication (QIPC) is a vigorously active cross-disciplinary field drawing upon theoretical and experimental physics, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and material science. Its scope ranges from fundamental issues in quantum physics to prospective commercial exploitation by the computing and communications industries."
11,7,eu_2010,3.1 QIPC research in Europe - European union level Research in Quantum Information Processing and Communication (QIPC) has a high risk nature and long-term outlook which is very much in scope of information and communication technologies (ICT). The “Future and Emerging Technologies” programme (FET) being part of the ICT research theme of European Commission has as early as in the mid 90’s recognized the potential of QIPC.
12,2,eu_2010,"In the late 80's and early 90's quantum phenomena were studied by projects funded by the EC in the field of optoelectronics and electronics with the aim to overcome the limitations to the respective state-of-the-art devices. In the Fourth Framework Programme (FP4, 1995 – 1998) this research gradually evolved towards the objective of “quantum information processing”. The focus was on the demonstration of quantum entanglement with photons, which was technologically more mature. In the mid 90's, important results were achieved by several groups in Europe and shortly after they became the driving force behind a number of FET projects."
12,3,eu_2010,"During 1998 the QCEPP working group (the so-called Pathfinder Project) laid the bases for the research field of QIPC at European level and was the first endeavour explicitly addressing this area of research. This working group produced an extensive report with a roadmap, a map of European research teams with relevant competencies and set the research agenda for several years ahead. It played a crucial role by organizing the research community, by stimulating it to reach critical mass within a short time period and by building the support for the launch of QIPC as a Proactive Initiative."
12,4,eu_2010,"The proactive initiative QIPC and its successors In FP5 (1999–2002) FET launched QIPC as a Proactive Initiative (PI). It was implemented via „calls for proposals"" directly targeted to QIPC and a certain amount of the FET budget was reserved in advance. There were two calls for proposals and 25 projects were launched with total cost of 41 M€ and EU funding of 31 M€. The contracts of the last group of FP5 projects finished at the end of 2005. Integrating the projects arising from the Open scheme with those supported through the proactive initiative and coordinate the work of all these projects was a main priority of the proactive initiative in FP5. Important traditions were also established at that time. Each year since the beginning of the proactive initiative two major events have been organized. The first one is a „cluster review and conference"". Its goals are to evaluate the work of each project and how its objectives fit within the cluster, to revise priorities if necessary and to evaluate the progress of the cluster as a whole. The second event is the annual European QIPC workshop where projects present their work. Both forums give the opportunity for interactions between the members of the projects and for cross-fertilization."
12,5,eu_2010,"In FP6 (2003–2006) QIPC continued as a FET PI. There was one call for Integrated Projects (IP) in September 2004. Three Integrated Projects succeeded in the evaluations and started in November 2005 with a contract for four years and total EU funding of 25 M€: SCALA  – Scalable Quantum Computing with Light and Atoms (9.4 M€) with a focus on the realization of a scalable quantum computer, by using individually controlled atoms, ions and photons; QAP – Qubit Applications (9.9 M€) with a focus on qubit applications that are based on photonic, atomic and solid state systems; EuroSQIP  – European Superconducting Quantum Information Processor"" (6M€): with a focus on developing a 3-5-qubit quantum information processor on platforms based on Josephson junction technology."
12,6,eu_2010,"In FP7 (2007-2013) the proactive initiave took on the new name “Quantum Information Foundations and Technologies” (QI-FT) and organized a call for proposals in 2009. Besides the ongoing objective to exploit the quantum nature of information for new ways of computing and communication, projects should also develop entanglement-enabled quantum technologies with a general potential for application in ICT. Three projects started in February 2010 with a total EU funding of 15 million Euros. Remarkably, also research groups from outside Europe were attracted by these projects coming from the US, Australia and Singapore. AQUTE  (5.3 M€) strives to realise an atomic, molecular and optical (AMO)-based."
13,2,eu_2010,"Q-ESSENCE  (4.7 M€) pursues the hybridization of quantum information media with a focus on making networks, long-distance entanglement, applications, and verification. These outcomes will be reached through the underpinning science and enabling technologies such as light-matter interfaces providing faithful interconversion between different physical realizations of qubits or quantum information concepts that solve problems of limited trust and privacy intrusion."
13,3,eu_2010,"SOLID (5.0 M€) is to develop small solid-state hybrid systems on common platforms based on microwave and optical nano-photonic cavities for the purpose of performing elementary quantum information processing tasks. Various types of solid-state qubits will be connected to these ""hubs"": Josephson junction circuits, quantum dots and NV centres in diamond.

15,7,eu_2010,"3.2 National funding As a basic research field, QIST is still traditionally funded by the different national governmental organisation depending on the country (ministry, governmental agency etc.). These agencies fund every research topics and QIST is typically a small percentage of the overall budget (in the percent range). However many of them have recently developed focus program or umbrella topics for QIST. The identified main national founders for each country are the following Austria Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) Zentrum für Innovation und Technologie GmbH City of Vienna Austrian Science Fund (FWF) Tiroler Zukunftsstiftung Belgium."
18,1,eu_2010,"As a highly promising field, QIST is often supported at the local level (city or region). Several examples in Europe have led to the creation of centers for Quantum Information, sometimes in a more general context. This funding can be quite stable in time, and usually consists in particular of a large startup sum, but also in a more long-term support. One can cite for instance: The region of Catalonia in Spain strongly supported the creation of the Institute for Photonic Science (ICFO) in 2002 in Barcelona, which has a strong emphasis on QIST. This institute is meant to be permanent and, when at full size, will employ up to 300 people; The Region of Tyrol and the city of Innsbruck in Austria also supported the creation of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI); this centre was mentioned as ""an example of outstanding quality"" for activity in atomic molecular and optical physics research in a recent report of the US National Research Council; The Region Paris-Ile-de-France through the creation of the Francilian Institute for Research on Cold Atoms (IFRAF), which comprises more than 30 groups from 6 different laboratories in Greater Paris; The United Kingdom is funding an Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) in QIPC between leading research universities and industrial laboratories. The initiative started in April 2004 with a funding level of 15M€ in four years; The German ministery for education and research (BMBF) launched in January 2010 a programme on quantum communication as part of its strategic initiative ""IKT 2020""."
18,2,eu_2010,"These initiatives can either, as for ICFO, create a new centre of excellence, or as in the case of IFRAF, construct a new centre of excellence from an existing pool of competence. In most cases the local funding is motivated by the development of a high-impact scientific field and high-level research, and it has a beneficial impact on local industry and economy."
18,3,eu_2010,"As possible applications of QIST become likely to appear in the near future, start-ups have begun to emerge. The main interest so far is in quantum cryptography, in particular Quantum Key Distribution. The oldest European company is IdQuantique, spin-off from the university of Geneva in 2001. Several new appeared recently: SmartQuantum , created in 2004 in Lagnon, France, Qutools  in Munich, Germany. Other competing start-ups for early adopters on the market are MagiQ , Optemax , and Qinetiq  from the USA. These companies are mostly spin-off of QIST research groups, funded through the usual start-up scheme: university incubators at the early stage of their existence, then business angels or hedge funds to sustain them beyond their first years of existence. They mainly develop commercial fibered QKD systems, but most of them admit that there is no real market for such system yet. There is however already a small but active market for Quantum-based Random Number Generators ( IdQuantique )."
18,4,eu_2010,"Quantum computing has also aroused interest for possible commercial applications. However the investment required and the timescale for developing a commercial quantum computer are much larger than for a QKD system.There is no start-up interested in developing a quantum computer in Europe so far, the only example known being in Canada, where one company ( D-Wave ) has been created in 1999."
18,5,eu_2010,"Several very large companies have also interest in QIST, with a focus on applied system research and components. In Europe, the main companies involved are Toshiba (UK), Thalès (France), France Telecom (France), Philips (Netherlands), Pirelli (Italy), Hitachi (UK) Hewlett-Packard (UK). Worldwide, companies such as IBM and NEC are also involved in QIST. The companies either have their own lab (Toshiba, HP, IBM), and/or can alternatively fund research groups (Philips). It has proven practically impossible to obtain reliable information about the amount of investment in QIST by these companies."
19,1,eu_2010,"Another interesting source of funding is the European Space Agency (ESA) . Several 50 k€ feasibility studies on Quantum Communication in space were successfully completed since 2002 and one experimental terrestrial 200 k€ study over 144 km horizontal free-space link is ongoing. Within ESA’s science program, the proposal Space-QUEST (to place a QKD terminal onboard the International Space Station) was rated as ‘outstanding’. Several European industries submitted proposals to develop a prototype engineering model of a faint laser and entangled photon source with a total budget of 600 k€. In the second half of 2008 a study on the feasibility of a QKD system on various future satellite missions is expected with 300k€. So far more than 1Mio€ have been spent on the different studies under evaluation at the time this report was made. But the overall budget for the Space-QUEST project, if it is accepted, would be approximately 80 M€ until 2014, with approximately 20% devoted to basic research. If successful, this would make ESA a major funding source for QIST in Europe."
19,2,eu_2010,"3.5 QIPC research in the international context Quantum information processing has become a scientific discipline with its own identity during the last ten years. The advent of quantum cryptography in the 80s and then the recognition of quantum computing in the 90s, for example using Shor’s algorithm, provided the motivation and have been the starting point of serious experimental and theoretical efforts to realize QIPC at large."
19,3,eu_2010,"Through the activities of the FET proactive initiatives in FP5, FP6 and now FP7, Europe has, in the main, been at the leading edge of QIS worldwide. The early spearheading of this high-risk R&D effort by the EC has aided in the creation of a number of national investments in QIS with the research area now reaching a more mature stage of medium/high risk. Until now, European publication output and quality has been on a par (and even superior) with the US, while other nations have begun systematic ramp-up in QIS investments."
19,4,eu_2010,"In the last years, significant growths in the research efforts within the field of QIST have been made worldwide. Especially the US has fostered their research activities, supported by a number of public funding agencies (for example the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). To retain our leading position in research and to capitalize on the Commission’s already significant investments in QIS (50M€ in FP5 and FP6, 45M€ in FP7), it is vital to ensure that the EU investment in QIS remains competitive with the US and other national/continental QIS investors."
19,5,eu_2010,"In the figure below we plot the 2008 funding figures in the QIPC area for the US, Canada, Japan and Europe. QIS R&D support on the scale of ~15M€/year puts Europe below average of worldwide QIS funding support. With such a potential decrease in international competitiveness, there is considerable risk that European research in QIS and the resulting technology developments (commercial and defense), will not be sustainable, leaving Europe reliant on importing such developed QIS technology from abroad."
21,2,eu_2013,"Within a decade, it will be possible to place sources of entangled photons on satellites, which will allow global quantum communication, teleportation and perfectly secure cryptography. Quantum cryptography relies on quantum communication technology but its progress and future impact on secure communication will depend on new protocols such as, for example, quantum-cryptographic authentication and quantum digital signatures."
21,3,eu_2013,"The next thing on the horizon is a quantum simulator. This is a quantum system in which the interactions between the particles could be engineered to simulate another complex system in an efficient way – a task that is inherently intractable on classical, but not quantum, technology. Building quantum simulators would allow, for example, the development of new materials, accurate description of chemical compounds and reactions, or a deeper understanding of high temperature superconductivity. The goal is to push the existing quantum technologies, such as optical lattices, to their limits and build quantum simulators within a decade or so."
21,4,eu_2013,"Last but not least, the search for scalable quantum information technologies goes on. This astonishing field appears to involve practically the whole of physics, and stretches the theoretical and experimental resources of every branch of physics, from quantum optics and atomic physics to solid state devices. It is likely that there will not be a single winner in this search: a number of different technologies will complement each other. Some of them will be more suitable for quantum memories, some of them for quantum processing, some for quantum communication and so on. Therefore, in addition to developing individual technologies, we also need interfaces between these technologies, so that we can transfer a qubit, for example, from a polarized photon to an electron in a quantum dot. The hybrid technologies and architectures for quantum computation, including interfaces between them, are the long-term goals for years to come."
21,5,eu_2013,"Quantum information technology is a fundamentally new way of harnessing Nature and it has potential for truly revolutionary innovation. There is almost daily progress in developing promising technologies for realising quantum information processing with various advantages over its classical counterparts. After all, the best way to predict the future is to create it. From the perspective of the future, it may well be that the real computer age has not yet even begun."

Different aspects of QIPC research in Europe Quantum Information Processing and Communication (QIPC) is a vigorously active cross-disciplinary field drawing upon theoretical and experimental physics, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and material science.

22,2,eu_2013,"In the late 80's and early 90's quantum phenomena were studied by projects funded by the EC in the field of optoelectronics and electronics with the aim to overcome the limitations to the respective state-of-the-art devices. In the Fourth Framework Programme (FP4, 1995 – 1998) this research gradually evolved towards the objective of “quantum information processing”. The focus was on the demonstration of quantum entanglement with photons, which was technologically more mature. In the mid 90's, important results were achieved by several groups in Europe and shortly after they became the driving force behind a number of FET projects."
22,3,eu_2013,"During 1998 the QCEPP working group (the so-called Pathfinder Project) laid the bases for the research field of QIPC at European level and was the first endeavour explicitly addressing this area of research. This working group produced an extensive report with a roadmap, a map of European research teams with relevant competencies and set the research agenda for several years ahead. It played a crucial role by organizing the research community, by stimulating it to reach critical mass within a short time period and by building the support for the launch of QIPC as a Proactive Initiative."
22,4,eu_2013,"The proactive initiative QIPC and its successors In FP5 (1999–2002) FET launched QIPC as a Proactive Initiative (PI). It was implemented via „calls for proposals"" directly targeted to QIPC and a certain amount of the FET budget was reserved in advance. There were two calls for proposals and 25 projects were launched with total cost of 41 M€ and EU funding of 31 M€. The contracts of the last group of FP5 projects finished at the end of 2005. Integrating the projects arising from the Open scheme with those supported through the proactive initiative and coordinate the work of all these projects was a main priority of the proactive initiative in FP5. Important traditions were also established at that time. Each year since the beginning of the proactive initiative two major events have been organized. The first one is a „cluster review and conference"". Its goals are to evaluate the work of each project and how its objectives fit within the cluster, to revise priorities if necessary and to evaluate the progress of the cluster as a whole. The second event is the annual European QIPC workshop where projects present their work. Both forums give the opportunity for interactions between the members of the projects and for cross-fertilization."
22,5,eu_2013,"In FP6 (2003–2006) QIPC continued as a FET PI. There was one call for Integrated Projects (IP) in September 2004. Three Integrating Projects (IPs) succeeded in the evaluations and started in November 2005 with a contract for four years and total EU funding of 25 M€: SCALA  – Scalable Quantum Computing with Light and Atoms (9.4 M€) with a focus on the realization of a scalable quantum computer, by using individually controlled atoms, ions and photons; QAP – Qubit Applications (9.9 M€) with a focus on qubit applications that are based on photonic, atomic and solid state systems; EuroSQIP  – European Superconducting Quantum Information Processor"" (6M€): with a focus on developing a 3-5-qubit quantum information processor on platforms based on Josephson junction technology."

However many of them have recently developed focus program or umbrella topics for QIST. The identified main national founders for each country are the following."
28,3,eu_2013,"As a highly promising field, QIST is often supported at the local level (city or region). Several examples in Europe have led to the creation of centers for Quantum Information, sometimes in a more general context. This funding can be quite stable in time, and usually consists in particular of a large startup sum, but also in a more long-term support. "
28,4,eu_2013,"One can cite for instance: The region of Catalonia in Spain strongly supported the creation of the Institute for Photonic Science (ICFO) in 2002 in Barcelona, which has a strong emphasis on QIST. This institute is meant to be permanent and, when at full size, will employ up to 300 people; The Region of Tyrol and the city of Innsbruck in Austria also supported the creation of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI); this centre was mentioned as ""an example of outstanding quality"" for activity in atomic molecular and optical physics research in a recent report of the US National Research Council; The Region Paris-Ile-de-France through the creation of the Francilian Institute for Research on Cold Atoms (IFRAF), which comprises more than 30 groups from 6 different laboratories in Greater Paris; The United Kingdom is funding an Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) in QIPC between leading research universities and industrial laboratories. The initiative started in April 2004 with a funding level of 15M€ in four years; The German ministery for education and research (BMBF) launched in January 2010 a programme on quantum communication as part of its strategic initiative ""IKT 2020"". "
28,5,eu_2013,"These initiatives can either, as for ICFO, create a new centre of excellence, or as in the case of IFRAF, construct a new centre of excellence from an existing pool of competence. In most cases the local funding is motivated by the development of a high-impact scientific field and high-level research, and it has a beneficial impact on local industry and economy."
28,7,eu_2013,"As possible applications of QIST become likely to appear in the near future, start-ups have begun to emerge. The main interest so far is in quantum cryptography, in particular Quantum Key Distribution. The oldest European company is IdQuantique, spin-off from the university of Geneva in 2001. Several new appeared recently: SmartQuantum , created in 2004 in Lagnon, France, Qutools  in Munich, Germany. Other competing start-ups for early adopters on the market are MagiQ , Optemax , and Qinetiq  from the USA. "
28,8,eu_2013,"These companies are mostly spin-off of QIST research groups, funded through the usual start-up scheme: university incubators at the early stage of their existence, then business angels or hedge funds to sustain them beyond their first years of existence. They mainly develop commercial fibered QKD systems, but most of them admit that there is no real market for such system yet. There is however already a small but active market for Quantum-based Random Number Generators ( IdQuantique ). "
28,9,eu_2013,"Quantum computing has also aroused interest for possible commercial applications. However the investment required and the timescale for developing a commercial quantum computer are much larger than for a QKD system.There is no start-up interested in developing a quantum computer in Europe so far, the only example known being in Canada, where one company ( D-Wave ) has been created in 1999."
29,1,eu_2013,"Several very large companies have also interest in QIST, with a focus on applied system research and components. In Europe, the main companies involved are Toshiba (UK), Thalès (France), France Telecom (France), Philips (Netherlands), Pirelli (Italy), Hitachi (UK) Hewlett-Packard (UK). Worldwide, companies such as IBM and NEC are also involved in QIST. The companies either have their own lab (Toshiba, HP, IBM), and/or can alternatively fund research groups (Philips). It has proven practically impossible to obtain reliable information about the amount of investment in QIST by these companies."
29,2,eu_2013,"Another interesting source of funding is the European Space Agency (ESA). Several 50 k€ feasibility studies on Quantum Communication in space were successfully completed since 2002 and one experimental terrestrial 200 k€ study over 144 km horizontal free-space link is ongoing. Within ESA’s science program, the proposal Space-QUEST (to place a QKD terminal onboard the International Space Station) was rated as ‘outstanding’. Several European industries submitted proposals to develop a prototype engineering model of a faint laser and entangled photon source with a total budget of 600 k€. In the second half of 2008 a study on the feasibility of a QKD system on various future satellite missions is expected with 300k€. So far more than 1Mio€ have been spent on the different studies under evaluation at the time this report was made. But the overall budget for the Space-QUEST project, if it is accepted, would be approximately 80 M€ until 2014, with approximately 20% devoted to basic research. If successful, this would make ESA a major funding source for QIST in Europe."
29,3,eu_2013,"3.5 QIPC research in the international context. Quantum information processing has become a scientific discipline with its own identity during the last ten years. The advent of quantum cryptography in the 80s and then the recognition of quantum computing in the 90s, for example using Shor’s algorithm, provided the motivation and have been the starting point of serious experimental and theoretical efforts to realize QIPC at large."
29,4,eu_2013,"Through the activities of the FET proactive initiatives in FP5, FP6 and now FP7, Europe has, in the main, been at the leading edge of QIS worldwide. The early spearheading of this high-risk R&D effort by the EC has aided in the creation of a number of national investments in QIS with the research area now reaching a more mature stage of medium/high risk. Until now, European publication output and quality has been on a par (and even superior) with the US, while other nations have begun systematic ramp-up in QIS investments."
29,5,eu_2013,"In the last years, significant growths in the research efforts within the field of QIST have been made worldwide. Especially the US has fostered their research activities, supported by a number of public funding agencies (for example the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). To retain our leading position in research and to capitalize on the Commission’s already significant investments in QIS (50M€ in FP5 and FP6, 45M€ in FP7), it is vital to ensure that the EU investment in QIS remains competitive with the US and other national/continental QIS investors. In the figure below we plot the 2008 funding figures in the QIPC area for the US, Canada, Japan and Europe. QIS R&D support on the scale of ~15M€/year puts Europe below average of worldwide QIS funding support. With such a potential decrease in international competitiveness, there is considerable risk that European research in QIS and the resulting technology developments (commercial and defense), will not be sustainable, leaving Europe reliant on importing such developed QIS technology from abroad."
69,6,uk_2014,"- Quantum nanotechnology implemented on a large scale for power recovery and generation, environmental sensing and efficient healthcare (massive markets for efficient photovoltaics, thermoelectrics and medical sensing / intervention). Novel electromagnetic or chemical (including spectroscopic) sensors and gravity sensors and ""imagers"" are also part of the future forward quantum technologies. Some more work is required to assess the capabilities and utility of quantum sensors over and above the capabilities of classical systems. "
69,7,uk_2014,"- Research and development in the quantum field are highlighted in this part. Quantum technology is being researched vigorously with most developed countries having a practical, or at least theoretical, research programme in place. World class research is conducted in the United States, UK,  China , Australia, Germany, Austria, France , Netherlands, Switzerland, Russia, Japan, Italy, and Canada among others. The competitive playing field is fairly level due to the propensity of the academic world to be very open, and to publish detailed results as soon as they can. There is also a high volume of interchange of researchers between institutions. "
69,8,uk_2014,"- The technological capability of a country thus depends strongly on having a range of world-class institutions characterized by academic freedom, strong academic connections, an appropriate industrial infrastructure, and fabrication facilities. However, this text takes special care to emphasize that a detailed study of the world picture is not a primary purpose of this report. Instead, the focus is on understanding the state of UK's activity in quantum research and identifying the leading institutions in key areas. "
69,9,uk_2014,"- It is clear from our analysis and the discussions at Chicheley on November 10 -12 2013 that the UK has a world-leading, or at least a world-class, academic standing in the majority of quantum technology areas. Details of our pre-eminence in specific areas have been discussed above in section 4. The UK R&D in quantum technology received a significant boost (i.e. £270M over 5 years) in the 2013 Autumn Statement and the challenge now is to maximize the benefit of this extra money."
69,10,uk_2014,"- In terms of inter-institutional collaboration, there is a general need for better connectivity and interaction between universities and teams inside universities. The groups present at the Chicheley meeting felt that there used to be a reasonable alignment between the aim of producing Nature papers and that of producing deliverable technology. However, this alignment is now seen as divergent, particularly in the UK. The new initiative represents a sea change in intent with fields such as engineering and IT reportedly being out of alignment with quantum advancements."
17,2,israel_2018,"The globe, led by the USA, China, Canada, Japan, Germany and the UK, have announced national programs to advance quantum technologies. According to a 2015 McKinsey report, in 2015 alone, 1.5B Euro were invested in non-classified quantum technologies research worldwide. The countries leading in spending were USA, spending 360M Euro, China 220M Euro, Germany 120M Euro, the UK 105M Euro and Canada, spending 100M Euro. The combined European Union expenditure was approximately 550M Euro. "

The introduction of research hubs on themes such as energy, health and sustainability has created an excellent opportunity for aligning quantum research with the wishes and requirements of potential end users."
34,2,netherlands_2019,"University of Groningen The Quantum Devices (QD) team is engaged in fundamental research into quantum coherent dynamics in solid-state devices (including organic molecules and semiconductors). The work has clear links to spintronics and quantum information applications, as illustrated by the recent experimental realization of a quantum state ('bit') at wavelengths within the telecommunications range. The Physics of Nano-systems team and the Spintronics and Magneto-optics of Nano materials team (each with one PI) are studying the interaction between the quantum mechanical degrees of freedom 'spin', 'charge', 'valley-chirality' and 'photon chirality' in new 2D materials and their heterostructures."
34,3,netherlands_2019,"The global playing field Although the Netherlands occupies a unique position, it is only one player in a major international push to develop quantum technologies, with Europe, North America and China to the fore. The quantum technology work being done in each of those regions is outlined below."
34,4,netherlands_2019,"Developments in Europe European scientists were very influential in the emergence of quantum mechanics in the early twentieth century; in recent decades, the region has also played a leading role in the further development of quantum technology. Established in November 2016, ERA-Net QuantERA has made several calls for proposals, with a view to funding projects with an emphasis on fundamental quantum technology research. The first call, in 2017, to which the Dutch Research Council contributed 1 million euros, led to the funding of nine projects with Dutch involvement. The exercise was an unprecedented success, with a high return on investment."
34,5,netherlands_2019,"Following publication of the Quantum Manifesto in 2016, the European Union launched a Quantum Technologies Flagship programme in 2017. With a budget of a billion euros, the programme is intended to promote public-private collaboration in Europe, and to establish the region as the world's leading centre for quantum technology development. In 2018, twenty projects were awarded grants totalling 132 million euros. Developments in quantum technology are also funded from other EU sources, including the European Research Council (ERC). In relative terms, the Netherlands does well in these EU programmes, as Figure 13 shows."
34,6,netherlands_2019,"In addition to the quantum technology funding by the EU, various individual member states, including France, Sweden and Switzerland, have their own programmes. Two national programmes warrant particular attention, one because of its pioneering role (UK) and one because its objectives are closely aligned with this Agenda (Germany)."
34,7,netherlands_2019,"United Kingdom The UK is one of the first European countries to invest in a coherent, national programme for quantum technology. In autumn 2013, the British government announced an investment of 270 million pounds (more than 300 million euros) over five years, with the emphasis on translating quantum technology to the market, promoting enterprise and boosting social impact. Cooperation among universities, enterprises and government bodies was encouraged, and the first funds were released at the start of 2015. The programme was therefore one of the first where the translation of quantum technology to industry (and wider society) was a primary objective, rather than solely investment in fundamental research."
34,8,netherlands_2019,"A feature of the programme was the formation of four Quantum Hubs, one for sensors and metrology, one for quantum-based imaging technology, one for networked quantum computing applications, and one for quantum information networks. Further investment in the hubs was announced at the end of 2018: an initial 80 million pounds (93 million euros), followed by a second tranche of 235 million pounds (273 million euros) for continuation and expansion of the national programme. Enabling technologies and education were among the fields targeted for investment."
35,1,netherlands_2019,"NATIONAL AGENDA FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGYAnother significant feature of the programme was consultation with all sectors of the community regarding the social and ethical implications of quantum technology. One recent product of that consultative approach was the 2018 Quantum Technologies Public Dialogue Report, commissioned by the British Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)."
35,2,netherlands_2019,"Germany  As well as being one of the central players in the Quantum Flagship programme, Germany is investing 650 million euros in its own national programme. With six lines of action, the German programme is intended to reinforce and promote cohesion in the academic world, to develop new technologies for the market, to encourage international collaboration, and to expedite social acceptance and adoption of quantum technology. The main topics addressed are the quantum computer, quantum communication, quantum sensors and basic technologies for quantum systems. Germany's programme therefore has clear parallels with the themes and focuses of our own National Agenda. The interest in quantum computing and artificial intelligence is further illustrated by the funding of about a hundred research posts at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, where a programme with a budget of 36 million euros has been started to investigate quantum and neuromorphic computing: a promising combination of technologies for applications such as quantum machine learning."
35,3,netherlands_2019,"4.3.2 Developments in Canada and the United States Canada  Over the last ten years, the Canadian government has invested 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 660 million euros) in quantum technology research and development. A particular hotspot for quantum technology is the city of Waterloo, whose university campus is home to the Institute for Quantum Computing, the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum Nano Centre, where research into quantum information and quantum computing is concentrated, with nearly four hun dred researchers active. The area also has infrastructure and lab facilities, training institutes for tech-entrepreneurship and Quantum Valley Investment (QVI). Consequently, Waterloo's Quantum Valley serves as a blueprint for a quantum technology ecosystem. Early in 2019, IBM announced that Waterloo would be the only Canadian university to act as an IBM Q-Network partner."
35,4,netherlands_2019,"Through QVI, private investors can contribute to quantum technology research and development. Unusually, researchers funded through QVI will retain the rights to their results and their commercial exploitation. Waterloo University has seeded more than 160 startups, a rapidly increasing proportion of which are working on quantum technology. Canada is consequently fifth in the global rankings for patent applications relating to quantum computing. Strong ties exist between the work being done in Canada and the research at QuSoft and the CWI."
35,5,netherlands_2019,"United States Scores of prominent universities and instit  utes in the US are working on quantum technology. However, the idea of a Quantum Hub or ecosystem has not gained traction. It is therefore interesting that, in November 2018, the Senate passed the National Quantum Initiative Act, which provided for 1.2 billion dollars (more than 1 billion euros) of existing funding to be allocated to research relating to quantum infor mation and quantum communication. NIST and NASA have been assigned an advisory role in the funding plan, while NIST and NSF are tasked with setting up standardization and research programmes, and NSF and the Depart  ment of Energy have been given responsibility for creating a number of Quantum Hubs. IARPA, DARPA and ARO – organizations within the US national intelligence service and Ministry of Defense – also play important roles in quantum technology research. Many of the companies active in the development of the quantum computer and quantum information technology are North American, including 1Qbit, Atom Computing, D-Wave, Google, Honeywell, HP, HRL Labs, IBM, Intel, ionQ, Lockheed-Martin, Microsoft, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and Rigetti. Such companies have large-scale national and international collaborative arrangements with knowledge institutions, including QuTech and QT/e; indeed, QuTech has also received support from IARPA."
35,6,netherlands_2019,"4.3.3 Developments in China In recent years, China has unveiled some notable achievements with quantum technology. For example, researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed the Micius quantum experimentation satellite within the space of ten years. The satellite was launched in 2016. Before long, an entanglement was realized between the ground station and the satellite, across a distance of 1,400 kilometres. In a collaboration with the University of Graz, the satellite was used in 2018 to send a QKD-encrypted signal across a distance of more than 7,600 kilometres. That remains a world record for quantum signal transmission. Micius also forms part of the quantum connection between Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan and Hefei (which also has the world's longest underground fibre-optic quantum network). In addition, China is striving to build the world's first quantum computer. In pursuit of that goal, the National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences is to be built near Hefei at a cost of 10 billion US dollars. Various Chinese companies are active in the quantum technology domain as well. In 2015, Aliyun (the cloud computing arm of the Alibaba Group) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced joint plans to build the Alibaba Quantum Computing Laboratory in Shanghai. In February 2018, the first cloud-based quantum computer service was unveiled. With an eleven-qubit system at the same laboratory as its basis, the service was then the second most powerful quantum computer service in the world, after IBM's."
35,7,netherlands_2019,"4.4 The balance between national strength and international collaboration The Netherlands is an important player in the international quantum technology field; years of investment in research and development have provided the country with a strong knowledge and innovation basis. The Netherlands is a leader in the fields of quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum simulation, as well as the development of associated applications and protocols for data security and other matters. At the moment, the seeds are being sown for increased collaboration between academia and industry, the development of prototypes and the first concrete quantum products and services, startups and spinoffs, and a national innovation ecosystem. Of course, the Netherlands is not alone in pursuing such policies; around the world, billions are being invested both through coordinated continental scale programmes (EU, US and Canada, China) and by individual countries (e.g. the UK, Germany and France). In one sense, that implies greater competition, not only to secure external investment, from large internationally active corporations and other sources, but also to attract and retain talent. However, quantum technology's implications for the security and welfare of our society depend to a significant extent on where the"
36,1,netherlands_2019,"The development of quantum technology in a democratic setting therefore has to entail collaboration, even if only to secure agreement regarding the responsible use of quantum technology. Global investment also creates opportunities: quantum technology is extremely complex and its full development will require a great deal of time, expertise, infrastructure and material resources. Even a country or bloc as large as the US or the EU is unlikely to be able to take all forms of quantum technology independently from their current, relatively basic levels to full commercial and social introduction. Hence, players all around the world will need to rely on one another and, to some degree, to work together by sharing results, sharing and building up infrastructure, bringing through talent and building up a workforce of quantum engineers to help integrate quantum technology within society."
36,2,netherlands_2019,"This Agenda therefore seeks to strike an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, the need to reinforce our national strengths in quantum technology, and to make the Netherlands as (internationally) attractive as possible for investment and as a base for internationally active institutes and enterprises, and, on the other hand, the need to increase the scope for international collaboration and knowledge-sharing as a means of boosting expertise and skill in the Netherlands. Those dual objectives are pursued by, on the one hand, investing in lines of activity and national catalyst programmes, and, on the other hand, by forging bilateral and multilateral partnerships, e.g. with Japan, Canada and the US, and by lobbying more actively for national quantum activities, e.g. in Brussels."
36,3,netherlands_2019,"The geographical concentration of the Netherlands' quantum technology expertise and facilities sets the country apart on the global stage. Furthermore, that concentration is reinforced by the Dutch culture of cooperation. The Netherlands is very strong in systems engineering and in combining technologies to form operational systems: fields that are vital for innovation. The country is therefore attractive to international companies willing to invest heavily in developing the quantum technology of the future. Meanwhile, at the local level, we are also seeing the first startups making commercial use of quantum technology. Our melting pot of knowledge, technology, industry and enterprise is creating growth centres, around which an ecosystem is starting to form. That represents an opportunity that must be seized. On the basis of this Agenda, we are therefore investing in the reinforcement of our nation's scientific basis, in the creation of technology-driven market opportunities, in building up and extending a national ecosystem, in education, and in securing a leading position in the social dialogue about quantum technology. As explained in Section 5, a number of action lines and national catalyst programmes have been defined as a means of channelling our strengths."
36,4,netherlands_2019,"The development of quantum technology is an international undertaking. The investment necessary and the complexity of the scientific and technological advances required are such that no nation is capable of developing the technology in isolation. Against that background, countries everywhere are investing heavily in quantum technology: the EU is investing a billion euros in the Quantum Flagship, while individual member states are ploughing hundreds of millions into national programmes. The US is investing more than a billion euros, and China is also allocating huge resources to quantum technology. Heavy international investment is both intensifying competition and creating opportunities for cooperation. With a view to taking full advantage of those opportunities, this Agenda also seeks to provide a basis for international collaboration. New bilateral alliances are being sought with Canada, the US and Japan. At the same time, the Agenda aims to promote cohesion and enhanced organization among national players, making it easier for the Dutch quantum technology community to speak with a single voice, particularly in Brussels, where key decisions are made regarding the research and innovation programmes of the future."
36,5,netherlands_2019,"The Netherlands' interests are best served by seeking the optimal balance between national strength and international cooperation. The realization of our national ambition to create the Quantum Delta NL, a world-leading centre and hub for quantum technology, represents a sizeable challenge, but a challenge we are quite capable of overcoming from our excellent starting position. That will, however, require the Netherlands and Europe to match the investments being made by others. And we will achieve our goals only if all parties give this Agenda their backing and support its ambition by committing the necessary resources."
2,2,india_2019,"In 2004 the United States came up with a detailed roadmap for developing the science and techniques required to start building a quantum information processor. Other nations - China in particular - also made serious efforts and committed substantial resources towards advancement in this emerging frontier. Recently recognizing the threat of losing their advantage in these rapidly emerging areas, the US government has recently taken up the National Quantum Initiative Act which aims to significantly ramp up research activities and funding in this area."

19,3,switzerland_2020,"The reason for the relatively large number and geographical diversity of quantum initiatives is linked to the view that “quantum advantage”, in particular within the fields of quantum computing and/or quantum communication, would confer an unassailable competitive advantage, both economic and societal, to the recipients. China, the EU and the US currently run the largest quantum technology programmes. This is not just in terms of the scale and scope of the areas of research addressed, but also in terms of technology development activities pursued."
19,4,switzerland_2020,"Of the three recently announced programmes, China’s programme is the most centrally coordinated. The US programme is also quite focused on “national security and economic competitiveness” and involves several governmental agencies, each with their own sub-objectives and sub-goals. Coordination between the agencies is achieved through a quantum information science subcommittee – with multi-agency representation – under the National Science and Technology Council."
19,5,switzerland_2020,"By contrast, the recent EU initiative, the Quantum Flagship, while also focused on developing “long-term economic, scientific, and societal benefits [for Europe]”, is more bottom-up than top-down. This is best illustrated by the fact that the Quantum Flagship projects were selected based on peer review rather than strategic intent at the level of the EU Commission, resulting in a more fragmented strategy. The EU Commission and the Flagship’s Board of Founders are the programme’s decision-making authorities. In this context, it is also important to note that China and the US in particular have tech giants very actively involved in developing quantum computing hardware platforms. This is not the case in the EU to the same extent."
20,1,switzerland_2020,"Other countries such as France, Germany and the UK in Europe, or Japan and South Korea in Asia have launched their own quantum technology programmes. The programmes in these countries are typically characterised by the same broad scope but on a smaller scale (and budget) compared to the larger programmes. There is often collaboration with the respective national industrial base and companies, e.g. ATOS and Thales in France, Bosch in Germany, Airbus in UK, Hitachi in Japan, etc. By and large, many of these companies are not in the same financial league as the tech giants and the advent of quantum technologies will not be, at least initially, so disruptive for their industry. For this reason, they are typically not yet as engaged at this point in time."
20,2,switzerland_2020,"The national programmes in this category are typically more targeted, leveraging research areas of strength rather than any (quantum) strength of a national industrial base. Consequently, there are currently very modest levels of involvement (and investment) from national industries. Industrial involvement is typically limited to providers of key enabling technologies and services rather than large corporates. This is perceived as an acceptable and desirable objective in the short term as part of efforts to establish a quantum cluster that will ultimately lead to a quantum industrial base. The UK, which has a more “quantum-ready” industrial base than the smaller nations in Europe, is particularly clear on this score."
20,3,switzerland_2020,"Both the UK and Netherlands took a very strategic, long-term position with respect to quantum technologies at an early stage (over five years ago). Since then, several other nations have followed, including Denmark (2016), Germany (2017) and Sweden (2017). Because of the lack of a relevant industrial base, smaller nations are often more open to collaboration with tech giants and/or non-national partners despite concerns among some sectors of their respective societies. This is due to the tacit acknowledgement of the paradigm-shifting consequences of quantum technologies for a nation’s societal wealth and security. Prominent examples in Europe include the Netherlands (Microsoft/Intel), Denmark (Microsoft), and Austria (Micius satellite)."
20,4,switzerland_2020,"Table 2 provides an overview of a selection of some of the most recent national initiatives and programmes to develop quantum technologies. The list is by no means comprehensive, even for a given country, but serves to highlight the increased level of activity in recent years."
22,4,switzerland_2020,"The fact that US tech giants (Google, Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft ) – recently joined by Chinese tech giants Alibaba, Huawai and Tencent – have substantial research and development programmes for universal quantum com puters has brought quantum technologies into the public eye, particularly during the last three years. In this perspective, the tech giants are almost perceived to be synonymous with quantum computing. This is not so surprising when one considers that each of them is spending more  than  many  countries do  on their national  initiatives.  "
22,5,switzerland_2020,"The majority of the tech giants are pursuing a platform based on superconducting circuits (generally considered to be the leading candidate at this point in the race ) with the exception of Microsoft, which is betting on topological quantum computing. Google and Intel are, however, hedging their bets in that they both have additional activities on quantum annealers (Google ) and spin qubits (Intel ). "
22,6,switzerland_2020,"It is also interesting that all companies are either very dependent on computational power to run their bus inesses (Google, Alibaba, and Tencent ), or their current business is to provide hardware, software and services (Microsoft, IBM, Intel ). Their motivation is clearly strategic and/or defensive but there is no doubt that their businesses would be significant ly impacted by a new computing paradigm such as  quantum computing.  "
22,7,switzerland_2020,"Within the last couple of years, IBM, Alibaba and Rigetti (one of several quantum computing start -ups that are beginning to appear ), have made their quantum computers accessible on -line and are actively developing quantum computing ecosystems. In addition to securing intellectual property, some  of them  are now  moving  to secure  the minds  and hearts  of corporate  customers.  IBM  in particular with the IBM Q Network, bolstered by the recent announcement of its stand -alone System One quantum computer whereby customers can have their own quantum computing system in -house for their exclusive use. Even Microsoft, though it has not yet announced that it has a topological qubit, has developed a full -stack software suite (which is also compatible with the other technology platforms ) and is engaging with customers and collaborators on, among other things, quantum inspired optimisation projects.  Although IBM was first out of the gate with their “quantum readiness” mantra, it is clear  that  several  others  are now  beginning  to pick  up the pace,  including  some  start -ups.  "
22,8,switzerland_2020,"It is interesting to note that while other quantum technologies such as quantum communication and quantum sensing have not received the same level of attention or funding from the tech giants listed above, these technologies have received significant interest (and funding ) from various national initiatives because of the obvious importance of secure communications and superior defence capabilities for national  security.  "
22,10,switzerland_2020,"Much  in the same  way  that  physicists  led the way  during  the first  quantum  revolution,  right  up to the invention  of the semi -conductor  transistor,  the subsequent  successful  development  of integrated  circuits and the laser necessitated educating engineers about solid -state physics. Today, solid -state electronics is a standard – and integral – part of all electronic engineering degree programmes. Back then, engineers  had to be educated  – by physicists  – about  quantum  physics.  By learning  the “language”  of quantum  physics  and developing  a basic  intuition  about  it, the necessary  basis  for fruitful  communication  was  established.  We are in the same  situation  today,  where  cross -disciplinary  skills  are at an even  greater  premium  given  the inherent  complexity  of quantum  technologies  at this point  in time.  "
22,11,switzerland_2020,"Several  universities  and national  initiatives  have  already  recently  established  courses  in quantum engineering while others have established centres for doctoral training (CDTs ) in quantum technologies,  some  of them  over  five years  ago,  e.g. University  College  London  (UCL ) in the UK. At UCL , the participants in the first CDT (which was called “Developing Quantum Technologies” ) were predominantly physicists – today there is a much greater proportion of engineers, computer scientists, chemists  in the quantum  CDTs.53 "
26,1,switzerland_2020,This is encouraging news for the current suppliers of QKD systems (both larger companies with a broad telecommunications equipment product portfolio like Toshiba and smaller companies with a focused portfolio like ID Quantique in Geneva) and it will drive the demand for QKD systems that have longer reach and faster bit rates. One indication of this increased interest are the recent investments made by South Korea Telecom and Deutsche Telekom – both telecommunication network operators – in ID Quantique.62
26,2,switzerland_2020,Industrial engagement within the field of quantum sensing is much more fragmented given the broad nature of the potential applications across a large number of different industries combined with the fact that no killer application has yet been identified: quantum sensing typically improves the sensitivity/accuracy for known applications or provides a cheaper/smaller alternative to existing sensing solutions.
26,3,switzerland_2020,"It is worth pointing out, however, that technologies such as quantum imaging (providing enhanced visibility in bad lighting conditions, including the ability to see around corners) and quantum timing (the ability to navigate autonomously without an operational satellite-based GPS infrastructure) are applications that are of great interest to the defence industry, where price often takes a second seat to performance. "
26,4,switzerland_2020,"In some instances, it may make more sense to incorporate the quantum sensors into an existing system thereby directly introducing quantum technologies into an existing industry. As many of these sensors measure parameters that are of interest across a broad range of industries and applications, many industries will become “quantum conversant” in this manner. In other cases, it may make more sense to provide a complete stand-alone system (whole product), which may be a more suitable proposition for a start-up rather than an established company. Either way, the fragmented nature of the space represents an interesting niche for both start-ups and industrial partners already providing sensing solutions that could be enhanced by quantum technologies."
26,5,switzerland_2020,"In 2016, Denmark established a national quantum initiative, the objective of which was to “bring quantum technologies to market” by “investing in activities that contribute as much as possible to the full application potential of quantum technology”.63 The consortium comprises three Danish universities (along with three non-Danish universities) and 16 industrial partners, half of which are non-Danish. The total budget for the first two-year phase of the initiative was approximately 21 million Euro: 10.5 million from the Innovation Fund Denmark (a Danish funding agency that invests in knowledge-based initiatives that will create growth and jobs) and 10.5 million from university and industrial partners in the form of cash and in-kind contributions. The scope of the activities covers quantum computing (including quantum algorithms), quantum communication, and quantum sensing (including quantum metrology). A significant proportion of the funded activities were collaborative projects between university and industrial partners. In addition to the technical work packages, there is also a work package dedicated to business development, the objective of which is to:"
27,3,switzerland_2020,"The university community aims to train and build an innovation culture, provide business development support for new businesses (start-ups) or new products in existing businesses, and create broader awareness and understanding among (non-quantum) stakeholders of the potential of quantum technologies. "
27,4,switzerland_2020,"Qubiz built upon a number of research centres of excellence within quantum technologies funded by the Danish National Research Foundation and two more were initiated shortly after Qubiz started. Despite this and a number of positive results from the initial phase, the funding for the second (three-year) phase was not granted by the Innovation Fund Denmark, illustrating the importance of matching the expectations and investment horizon of the funding source with the maturity of the technology. It also underscores the importance of establishing a broadly-based coalition of stakeholders with a long-term, strategic funding perspective. "
27,5,switzerland_2020,"In 2015, The Netherlands established a ten-year quantum initiative, QuTech, with the mission to “develop scalable prototypes of a quantum computer and an inherently safe quantum internet”. The initiative, which grew out of a two-year precursor project of the same name, is built up around several departments at the Technical University of Delft (TUD) and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), but now also includes the Ministry for Economic Affairs, the Ministry for Education, Science and Culture, and the two Dutch organisations responsible for basic research (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research NWO) and high-tech investments (Top Sector Alliance for Knowledge and Innovation TKI), respectively. The presence of both Microsoft and Intel on campus at TUD has been instrumental in triggering some components of the funding from NWO and TKI. "
27,6,switzerland_2020,"The total budget for the ten-year period is 146 million Euro, of which approximately one-third is provided by TNO, one-third is provided by NWO and TKI combined, and the remaining one-third is provided by TUD itself. Approximately 80% of the total funding is cash. The programme is organised around three mission-driven science and technology road maps (led by TUD principal investigators): Fault tolerant quantum computing, Quantum internet and networked computing, Topological quantum computing. In addition, there is an engineering road map (led by TNO): Shared technology development (SHD). "
27,7,switzerland_2020,"Since the establishment of QuTech, two new quantum initiatives (with a smaller scope but also mission-driven) have been established in the Netherlands: QuSoft at the University of Amsterdam and the Eindhoven Q Center at the Technical University of Eindhoven. Combined with the highly successful mid-term evaluation of QuTech earlier this year, there was a basis for establishing a quantum national agenda programme (four-year) to bring all relevant stakeholders in the Netherlands, including industry, together to accelerate the economic impact of quantum technologies and address common societal challenges. The strength of a quantum national agenda developed in this manner is that it has grown organically, albeit over a longer period of time, but builds upon established collaborations and relationships and is therefore intrinsically more cohesive than otherwise would be the case."
28,4,switzerland_2020,"In 2016, the Austrian Council of Ministers announced a new national R&D funding programme for quantum research and technology, including demonstrators. The objective of the programme was threefold: to further increase the cooperation of Austrian researchers and companies in European and international initiatives; to enable the development of quantum relevant skills and R&D infrastructure; to support the transfer of R&D results into value and demonstrators. "
28,5,switzerland_2020,"The budget for the initial four -year ramp -up phase (2017 -2021 ) is 32.7 million Euro and is provided through the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, the national funding agency for industrial research and development, and the Austrian Fund for the Promotion of Scientific Research. Funding is allocated on a yearly basis through a competitive application process and projects are evaluated on an annual basis. 4.5 million Euro will be allocated during 2019. "
28,6,switzerland_2020,The scope of the programme is broad in that there are no pre -defined areas within quantum science and technology and it is not mission -driven. The Austrian initiative not only builds upon a number of early initiatives such as the Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology and the Erwin Schroedinger Center for Quantum Science and Technology but also specifically strengthens these initiatives as integral parts of the QFTE programme.
28,7,switzerland_2020,The strength of a funding programme of this nature is that it maintains a greater level of flexibility and agility compared to more mission -driven programmes but without the latter’s focus and concentration of resources on specific objectives and outcomes.

Currently, the world is in the midst of a historic paradigm shift in economic and social structures."
4,2,japan_2020,"Trends in other countries regarding quantum technology. In other countries, mainly in the United States, Europe, and China, quantum technology is clearly positioned as a strategic core technology, and in recent years, significant investments in research and development have been made. In addition to expansion, it is developing strategic initiatives such as establishing research and development bases and developing human resources."

In addition, the EU has compiled the “Final Report on Quantum Technology Flagship” and has started projects on a scale of 1 billion euros from 2018. In addition, in the United Kingdom, Germany, etc., after positioning a wide range of quantum technologies as important technologies, the government is promoting research and development projects and forming research and development bases, thereby significantly expanding investment."
4,4,japan_2020,"In China, quantum computers are positioned as a major science and technology project, and quantum information. The economy and society are making a discontinuous transition to a knowledge-intensive type that differs from the conventional labor- and capital-intensive type. Appropriately capturing this transition is the key to Japan's international competitiveness. In addition, Japan's geopolitical position and the international environment surrounding high-tech hegemony are undergoing drastic changes. Approximately 7 billion yuan is being invested in the development of the national research laboratory."
4,5,japan_2020,"Outside the government, large IT companies (Google, IBM, Intel, Alibaba, etc.) and venture companies (D-Wave, Rigetti, IonQ, etc.), mainly in Europe, the United States, and China, are developing quantum technologies such as quantum computers. are actively investing in In October 2019, Google announced in the English scientific journal Nature that it had achieved “quantum supremacy” for the first time using a quantum computer that it independently developed. The competition is intensifying, such as announcing that it has demonstrated that it surpasses in computing power."
4,6,japan_2020,"Japan is the first country in the world to advocate “Society 5.0” and “data-driven society” as visions of society that it should aim for in the future. It has become an important technological infrastructure that is the source of power. Quantum technology is the key fundamental technology for further dramatic and discontinuous development of such important technological infrastructure. From this point of view, in recent years, the international attention on quantum technology has been rapidly increasing. We are accelerating our efforts. "
56,1,japan_2020,Foreign trends surrounding quantum technology include government initiatives and efforts of representative companies. The exchange rate is calculated based on the standard foreign exchange rate and the arbitrage foreign exchange rate announced by the Minister of Finance of Japan for the month at the time of the announcement.
56,2,japan_2020,"Overseas, mainly in the United States, Europe, and China, “quantum technology” is positioned as an important technology that will bring about major changes in the economy and society, and government-led research and development strategies are formulated. In recent years, we have significantly expanded R&D investment and strategically developed R&D bases and human resource development. "
56,3,japan_2020,"In June 2017, the European Commission's panel of experts formulated an R&D strategy. Major IT companies in each country are also actively investing, and the establishment and funding of venture companies are also progressing. $3 billion research investment over 5 years (2014-)In addition, each country started research and development with its own budget. Especially, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom formed international research bases. "
56,4,japan_2020,"In September 2018, the National Science and Technology Council formulated a National Strategy Outline for Quantum Information Science. In December 2018, a law was enacted concerning investment of up to $1.3 billion (approximately 140 billion yen) over five years from 2019. Developed a superconducting quantum computer. Raised approximately $120 million. Centered on DOE and NSF, about 10 bases for R&D and human resource development are formed."
56,5,japan_2020,"In the 13th Five-Year Plan for Science and Technology Innovation (2016), quantum communication and quantum computers are positioned as major science and technology projects and are actively invested. Establishment of the National Laboratory for Quantum Information Science in Hefei City, Anhui Province is under construction at a cost of 7 billion yuan (approximately 120 billion yen) (scheduled for completion in 2020). Major IT companies and ventures have also made significant strides. How to advance quantum technology is at a crossroads as global competition intensifies."
49,2,sa_2021,"Quantum technologies are no longer only the purview of laboratory experiments as private industry has quickly adopted the most robust ideas into applications. For example, atomic clocks are a very mature technology: cutting-edge laboratory clocks would not gain nor lose a second in 40 billion years, while chip-scale manufacturing technologies have led to the development of extremely miniaturised clocks that are now commercially available. Technologies working on similar principles to atomic clocks allow for the detection of weak magnetic fields and have been used to fabricate atomic vapour sensor arrays used for brain wave detection. Similarly, the geo-surveying industry is benefiting from commercial gravimeters based on laser-cooled, magneto-optically trapped atoms, while quantum random number generators are available off-the-shelf for quantum encryption. On the quantum computing front, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Lockheed Martin all have quantum computing development projects, with D-wave offering a commercially available quantum computer based on an adiabatic quantum computing architecture with several hundred qubits."
49,4,sa_2021,"The aim of this section is to provide a concise overview of quantum technology strategies and investments worldwide. These efforts are motivated by the current race to develop the world’s best quantum technology. Arguably, the two biggest contestants are the USA and China [3.1]. All strategy documents stress the need of the joint effort of academia and industry to develop the full economic benefits of these new technologies."
50,1,sa_2021,"Developed  nations  have  invested  heavily  over  the  past  two  decades  in  establishing a vibrant  research  community  studying  quantum  computing  and  quantum  technology related  physics [3.2,  3.3].  Many  policy  documents  on  national  efforts  to  develop  these technologies  have  been  compiled  [3.4-3.9],  and  more  recently,  governmental  funding  in many  of  these  countries  have  been  increasingly  funneled  toward  transforming  laboratory successes  into  marketable  technologies  according  to  well-defined  roadmaps [3.10-3.12].  It  is  clear  that  a  new  industry  is  on  the  horizon  with  many  opportunities  to contribute  [3.13],  ranging  from  being  a  full-scale  quantum  computer  and  technology manufacturer  to  a  supplier  of  enabling  technologies  and  quantum  computing  software solutions  for  international  companies."
50,2,sa_2021,"The  United  Kingdom  was  a  pioneer  in  the  establishment  of  national  initiatives.  Its  Strategy  was  published  in  2015  and  has  invested  more  than  £1bn  since  then  [3.14].  In 2014  the  UK’s  National  Quantum  Technologies  Programme  [3.15]  was  launched,  with  The  Quantum  Communications  Hub  led  by  the  University  of  York  [3.16].  The  programme was  renewed  again  in  2019  for  a  further  5  years,  with  investments  in  four  quantum technology  hubs:  Sensors  and  timing,  Quantum  enhanced  imaging  (QuantIC), Quantum  computing  and  simulation,  and  Quantum  communications  Technologies (Quantum  Communications  Hub). This  has  led  to  significant  advances  having  been made  on  the  technology  front,  including  chip-to-chip  QKD,  fibre  based  QKD  over  ~100 km,  and  wireless  QKD  between  a  handheld  device  and  a  wall  mounted  terminal.  The investment  in  Quantum  Computing  covers  the  full  stack  of  hardware  and  software,  from core  technologies  to  potential  applications  including  the  discovery  of  novel  drugs  and materials,  quantum-enhanced  machine  learning,  and  carbon  reduction  through  resource optimisation."

The second stage prepares the connection of quantum computers and sensors in a full Quantum Information Network. This quantum communication infrastructure will be used for data transit and storage in a highly secure way. It is designed to ultimately link sensitive public and private communication assets all over the EU, such as banks and administrations. "
51,3,sa_2021,"On 6 March 2020, the European Union presented the Strategic Research Agenda of the Quantum Flagship Project.
